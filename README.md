# flower-Store

A flower shop that contains a flower catalog,
the possibility to connect as a manager or as an employee or as a customer.

I built the site in the SPA (Single Page Application) architecture on the node\express server 
using jquery and bootstrap.

When we connect to the site as the store manager
 - we can view the store catalog
 - enter the user management tab where you can:
       - delete a user
       - add a new user as a manager/employee/customer
       - the possibility to update certain user details

When we connect to the website as an employee:
we can do the same thing but the website will only let us 
      - add a user as a new customer and not as a new manager or employee
      - update user details only of customers and employees but not of managers

When we log in as a customer, we will see the store, but without a user management tag:
